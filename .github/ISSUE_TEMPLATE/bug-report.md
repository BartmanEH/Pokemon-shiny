1. shiny pokemon (name? family? pokedex id?)
2. release date.
3. shiny image.

You could find image in [PokeMiners](https://github.com/PokeMiners/pogo_assets/commits/master/Images/Pokemon%20-%20256x256/Addressable%20Assets) site. Just paste the image path to here. It is super helpful!

You could delete all of above after you read them to create a new issue.Thanks~
